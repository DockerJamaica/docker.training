Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub
issues for bug reports and feature requests.

You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on our
`forum <https://docker.jamaicans.dev>`_ ("Link to Docker Jamaica")
where the questions should be tagged with ``docs``.

Bugs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you find a bug in the source code or documentation, you can help us by
submitting an issue to our 
`Github Repository <https://github.com/DockerJamaica/docker.training/issues>`_.

Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.
